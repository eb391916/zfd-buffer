                <p>In 2021, the annual Soul of Athens project came at a time of pandemic fatigue. After a year of isolation, anxiety, loss, and "unprecedented times," our project team wanted to utilize our skills in visual communications to make a difference for an Athens business. We pitched our idea to Scott Bradley, owner, operator, and head chef at Zoe Fine Dining. Fortunately, he accepted. We set out to tell the story of how Zoe Fine Dining is vital to the very soul of Athens.</p>

                        <p>Zoe Fine Dining, like most restaurants in the past year, has been vastly impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. Along with the rest of the business world, Bradley had to turn the restaurant's business model upside down almost overnight. Zoe's full-course dining experience, VIP service and moody ambiance are absolutely key to its identity as a fine dining restaurant, so Bradley says closing the dining room was a big hit. For the health and safety of staff and patrons, Zoe's dining room remained closed until quite recently. Previously their impeccable dishes were only available for takeout. Inevitably, the restaurant's operations have been impacted and there is an air of uncertainty about the future - one which we are now all too familiar with, this far into a global pandemic.</p>

                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>With 17 years in business, Zoe Fine Dining has come a long way since its debut in the Eclipse Company Town, which is a small gathering of buildings in The Plains. Over the years, Zoe has developed its sophistication, its style and even its physical size into the beloved local business that it is today. To illustrate the restaurant's progress and growth, it was time for a rebrand complete with a new website. Especially during times of heightened online ordering brought on by a global pandemic, it's crucial for Zoe to upgrade its digital presence from exclusively social media to a website of its own.</p>

                <button class="accordion"><h3>Our Solution</h3></button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>Our team set out to give Zoe Fine Dining the visual and conceptual tools to amplify its brand story, through the pandemic and beyond, by researching the business to inform our work, defining and designing a strong brand platform and visual style, and implementing that brand into a website as well as a few key physical deliverables. We devised creative solutions to work within the boundaries of masks, a closed dining room and other pandemic restrictions to produce materials both specifically for marketing during COVID and evergreen content that will last beyond this period of global strife.</p>

                <p>Before we began intervening with Zoe's identity, it was imperative that we familiarized ourselves with this identity, which includes its place in the community, as well as how it serves as a personal reflection of its owner. We began this process by interviewing Bradley himself about Zoe's origin story, how he would best describe his business, and how he defines the restaurant's approach to fine dining.</p>

                <p>Next, we interviewed a sample of Zoe's customer base. Our 12 interviewees covered a wide range of customer types, from locals who had never visited the fine dining establishment, to regular customers who feel that Zoe and its staff are like family. We asked each interviewee to describe Zoe in their own words and conducted a similar interview with staff. Themes began to emerge from commonly expressed sentiments. We heard often that Zoe is a place that makes you feel special - and it's a special place that is like no other in Athens. It offers a prime spot to celebrate, exquisite service, pointed wine pairings, and a charming ambiance. Most of all, Zoe serves a unique, flavorful, artistic and gourmet menu of consistently high-quality food and immaculate presentation.</p>

                <p>We also identified and reviewed competitor restaurants within 80 miles of Zoe, and peer fine dining restaurants located around the world to get a sense for industry trends and standards. This research also helped to make Zoe's unique energy and standing within the realm of fine dining increasingly clear. Zoe is eclectic, sophisticated, imaginative, intimate, and warm. It has a local feel. It's more approachable than the stereotypical fine dining establishment and it creates space for community and connection.</p>

            <div class="inner-block2"> <!-- open .inner-block2 -->
                <p>Zoe means "life" in Greek - hence its tagline, "Food is Life. That fact, combined with the discovery during our research phase of Zoe's liveliness, influenced our team to develop a brand concept inspired by "life." "To life" is a toast. It speaks to Bradley's approach to cooking - an enduring passion for "surprise and delight." It reflects the celebratory nature of many visits to Zoe - birthdays, anniversaries, congratulations, and even just an evening well-spent. And it alludes to the way Zoe brings fine dining, food and the Athens community <i>to life.</i></p>

                <p>For the visual elements of the brand, we were inspired by visual cues in the restaurant, including the thriving green potted plants that adorn the space and the moon symbolism of Zoe's logo, which features an eclipse to call back to its roots. We also pulled from the eclectic nature of the restaurant and translated it into organic patterns and a pop of bright color for visual variation. The photography style is moody with dark tones and high contrast, to speak to the elegance of an evening at Zoe. Delectable food and the celebratory toast of full glasses are major visual motifs.</p>

                <p>With a brand established, Zoe's website was the priority deliverable for implementation. Given the need for an ever-evolving menu with rotating specials and even a flexible business model due to the unpredictable trajectory of the pandemic, the website needed to have a usable content management interface for the client to have the ability to make updates. Our platform of choice was Wordpress.</p>

                <p>The project team built a website that exhibit's Zoe's story and gives the customer the practical details they are looking for. That process included developing wireframes, working with a base "theme," customizing visuals and functionality, as well as curating content in order to create a fully designed and functional site.</p>

                <p>In addition to the website, we also created designs and templates for menus, signage, social media posts and online ads, each of which has built-in purpose and potential beyond COVID times.</p>
